            <h2>Act I - The Magic of Games</h2>
            <p>
                Games are having a moment. Video games, in particular, are more engaging than ever, but board games are experiencing a Cambrian explosion, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost everyone plays games. Children and teenagers are obsessed with making masterpieces in <em>Minecraft</em> or designing and playing their own creations in <em>Roblox</em>. Adults  relax for countless hours playing cozy games like <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>, or get lost exploring in games in the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> series. Then there's the unmatched pull of games on smartphones; these mobile monsters cause us to lose so much time.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is it about games that enrapture us so? Why is it that we will spend so much of our free time solving challenges and completing tasks that don't matter to our lives?
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the <em>feelings</em> that games give us. It's the feeling that our choices matter, even to a virtual character or made up world; we can effect change. It's that we can tangibly experience ourselves getting better even when we fail at a task or challenge. It's the connections we feel as we play with others, contribute to communities revolving around the game, or even the emotional payoffs we have from helping non-player characters (NPCs) in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's these feelings &dash; <span class="autonomy-name">autonomy</span>, <span class="competence-name">competence</span>, and <span class="relatedness-name">relatedness</span> &dash; that form the foundations of <em>motivation</em>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="act act-II">
            <h2>Act II - The Psychology of Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                This framework of motivation is called <b>Self-Determination Theory</b> and it was developed by <cite>Edward Deci and Richard Ryan</cite>. According to this theory humans learn best (and in general tend to thrive) when three main needs are met:
            </p>
            <ul class="sdt-list">
                <li><span class="autonomy-name">Autonomy</span>: The feeling that we have the freedom to make meaningful choices.</li>
                <li><span class="competence-name">Competence</span>: The feeling that we can grow and improve.</li>
                <li><span class="relatedness-name">Relatedness</span>: The feeling that we belong or connect to others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When these needs are sufficiently met, then people are more easily able to reach a state of <em>psychological flow</em>. This <em>flow</em> state is the same one discussed by <cite>Mihály Csíkszentmihályi</cite>, in which people easily lose track of time and challenges feel fun, especially if they are scaffolded well for our abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, when these needs are not met, engagement becomes shallow and more externally focused. In other words, when people feel <em>enough</em> autonomy, competence, and relatedness, they develop <span class="intrinsic-motivation">intrinsic motivation</span>, where they enjoy the activity for the sake of the activity. However, when they don't, they are more likely to develop <span class="extrinsic-motivation">extrinsic motivation</span>, which still gets them to do the activity, but only (or primarily) for the reward offered during or after completion.

            <h2>Act III - Gamification versus Gamefulness</h2>
            <p>
                Gamification seeks to make use of game elements in non-game contexts (Deterding et al. **year**), like classrooms and workshops. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While it sounds great on the surface (add points and badges to make a topic more fun), it's important to be intentional about applying these game elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gamification gone wrong can lead us down a road toward building what game designer Ian Bogost calls "exploitationware" (Bogost, **year**). Shallow implementations, like grafting on points and badges without much thought, can lead to disengagement and extrinsic motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gamification done well, on the other hand, is more aligned with something called <b>gamefulness</b> or <b>gameful learning</b>. This is something closer to what Karl Kapp focuses on in his research and books. In gameful learning, the gamification system is constructed in such a way that emphasizes the components of intrinsic motivation: <span class="autonomy-name">autonomy</span>, <span class="competence-name">competence</span>, and <span class="relatedness-name">relatedness</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This concept of gameful learning is core to the framework proposed by <cite>Proulx et al. (2017)</cite>. In their paper, they link a variety of game mechanics to the needs of Self-Determination Theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This explorable explanation seeks to build on <cite>Proulx et al. (2017)</cite>'s work by:
            </p>
            <ul class="learning-goals-list">
                <li>
                    <b>Contrasting</b> <span class="shallow-implementation">shallow</span> and <span class="meaningful-implementation">meaningful</span> implementations of select game mechanics as they relate to different psychological needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sharing</b> non-digital "recipes" that educators can adapt and implement into their own classrooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Experimenting</b> with the game mechanics by making them come to life through play.

                Below, you'll find a table/matrix. On the left side are our <b>Game Mechanics</b> and along the top we see our <b>Self-Determination Theory Needs</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each cell represents a choice that we have as instructional designers. We can choose to <em>nurture intrinsic motivation</em> through what I'm calling a <span class="meaningful-implementation">meaningful</span> implementation or we can <em>hinder it</em> through a <span class="shallow-implementation">shallow</span> implementation.
            </p>

            <h2>Act VI - Gameful Design</h2>
            <p>
                As we saw above, each game mechanic can be implemented in <span class="meaningful-implementation">meaningful</span> or <span class="shallow-implementation">shallow</span> ways. The trick is the intentionality behind their design.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Gameful design</b> doesn't have to involve digital tools since many of these game mechanics can be implemented using paper prototypes, discussions, or other analog media and methods. <em>Please take a look at and modify any of the "non-digital recipes" that resonate with you.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                But arguably, the most important part of design is <b>empathy</b>; designing for learners depends on how they each (and collectively) experience <span class="autonomy-name">autonomy</span>, <span class="competence-name">competence</span>, and <span class="relatedness-name">relatedness</span>. When we design our environments (e.g., classrooms, trainings, etc.) to intentionally foster <b>choice</b>, <b>mastery</b>, and <b>connection</b>, we're not only helping our learners learn better, we're helping them thrive as human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll leave you with one final question:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b><em>How might you pursue intrinsic motivation in your own learning spaces?</em></b>
