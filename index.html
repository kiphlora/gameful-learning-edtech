            <p>
                Games are having a moment. Video games, in particular, are more engaging than ever, but board games are experiencing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian explosion</a>, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost everyone plays games. Children and teenagers are obsessed with making masterpieces in <em>Minecraft</em> or designing and playing their own creations in <em>Roblox</em>. Adults  relax for countless hours playing cozy games like <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>, or get lost exploring in games in the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> series. Then there's the unmatched pull of games on smartphones; these mobile monsters cause us to lose so much time.

                What is it about games that enrapture us so? Why is it that we will spend so much of our free time solving challenges and completing tasks that don't matter to our lives?
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the <em>feelings</em> that games give us. It's the feeling that our choices matter, even to a virtual character or made up world. It's that we can tangibly experience ourselves getting better even when we fail at a task or challenge. It's the connections we feel as we play with others, contribute to communities revolving around the game, or even the emotional payoffs we have from helping non-player characters (NPCs) in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's these feelings &dash; <span class="autonomy-name keyword">autonomy</span>, <span class="competence-name keyword">competence</span>, and <span class="relatedness-name keyword">relatedness</span> &dash; that form the foundations of <em>motivation</em>.

            <h2>Act II - The Psychology of Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                This framework of motivation is called <b>Self-Determination Theory</b> and it was developed by Deci & Ryan, 2000. According to this theory humans learn best (and in general tend to thrive) when three main needs are met:
            </p>
            <ul class="sdt-list">
                <li><span class="autonomy-name keyword">Autonomy</span>: The feeling that we have the freedom to make meaningful choices.</li>
                <li><span class="competence-name keyword">Competence</span>: The feeling that we can grow and improve.</li>
                <li><span class="relatedness-name keyword">Relatedness</span>: The feeling that we belong or connect to others.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <br> -->
            <!-- Embed YouTube video on Self-Determination Theory -->
            <div class="video-container" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; padding: 20px;">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sRBBNkSXpY?si=bOoa37pdP4FBLmzK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
                When these needs are sufficiently met, then people are more easily able to reach a state of <em>psychological flow</em>. This <em>flow</em> state is the same one discussed by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, in which people easily lose track of time and challenges feel fun, especially if they are scaffolded well for our abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, when these needs are not met, engagement becomes shallow and more externally focused. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, when people feel <em>enough</em> autonomy, competence, and relatedness, they develop <span class="intrinsic-motivation">intrinsic motivation</span>, where they enjoy the activity for the sake of the activity. However, when they don't, they are more likely to develop <span class="extrinsic-motivation">extrinsic motivation</span>, which still gets them to do the activity, but only (or primarily) for the reward offered during or after completion.

            <h2>Act III - Gamification versus Gamefulness</h2>
            <p>
                Gamification seeks to make use of game elements in non-game contexts (Deterding et al., 2011a; Deterding et al., 2011b), like classrooms and workshops. Apps like <em>Duolingo</em> or <em>Headspace</em> tend to use gamification to encourage adherence, engagement, and consistency.

            </div>
            <p>
                While it sounds great on the surface, it's important to be intentional when applying these game elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gamification gone wrong can lead us down a road toward building what game designer Ian Bogost calls "exploitationware" (Bogost, 2011). Shallow implementations, like grafting on points, badges, and leaderboards without much thought, can lead to disengagement and extrinsic motivation.

                Gamification done well, on the other hand, is more aligned with something called <b>gamefulness</b> or <b>gameful learning</b>. This is something closer to what Karl Kapp focuses on in his research and books (Kapp, as cited by Bevins & Howard, 2018). In gameful learning, the gamification system is constructed in such a way that emphasizes the components of intrinsic motivation: <span class="autonomy-name keyword">autonomy</span>, <span class="competence-name keyword">competence</span>, and <span class="relatedness-name keyword">relatedness</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This concept of gameful learning is core to the framework proposed by Proulx et al. (2017). In their paper, they link a variety of game mechanics to the needs of Self-Determination Theory.

            <h2>How to Use the Game Mechanics Cards</h2>
            <p>
                You can select a card by clicking on it. This will reveal that mechanic's section, where you'll find:
                <ul>
                    <li>A brief description and introduction to that mechanic.</li>
                    <li>Sub-sections with shallow and meaningful implementations, as well as reflection questions for each self-determination theory need.</li>
                    <li>A non-digital recipe that you can try out to experience the mechanic in a tangible way in your own classroom.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To encourage <b>autonomy</b>, the cards allow you to visit the mechanics in any order you want. To encourage <b>competence</b>, you can track your progress using the earned badges. And to encourage <b>relatedness</b>, you can share your reflections with others using the download button found in the box below.

                In games, <b>points</b> are a very commonly used mechanic. Most often they are coupled with <b>competition</b> to determine overall winners using the accumulation of points earned through various in-game actions. A common implementation is the <em>High Score</em>, more common in older video games and arcade games. High scores are  essentially a form of <em>Leaderboard</em>.

                <p>
                    Let's consider how this very common mechanic connects to the self-determination theory need of autonomy. When it comes to autonomy, the key is <em>choice</em>, so <b>points</b> need to represent some kind of meaningful decision. Here are some examples of both meaningful and shallow implementations you can try out.

                    <p>
                        One way to implement meaningful choice into points is through allowing learners to <em>select from a menu of challenges, each with different point values related to their difficulty or required skill</em>.

                        In essence, the absense of choice is what makes an approach shallow.

                    <p>
                        These are already commonly used when it comes to <em>required assessments</em> that have point values assigned by the educator and there's no choice given to the learner about the assignment's weight, the type of assignment, the skills assessed, or other aspects of the assignment.

                    Let's ponder how points connect to the next need: competence. When it comes to competence, the essential focus is on <em>growth</em>, and eventually <em>mastery</em> in the skill or topic. <b>Points</b> need to represent progress toward that goal of mastery. Let's look at a meaningful versus shallow implementation of points with respect to competence.

                        The keys here are ensuring that the points feel connected to the development, so the learners can see their progress in mastering particular skills.

                    <p>
                        A simple visual representation for this is a <em>progress bar</em>, which quickly provides feedback about where they started, where they're going, and how far along they are right now. Different progress bars for different skills can provide quick feedback about the state of their learning.

                        On the other hand, an example of a shallow implementation is one where the points don't really matter and act as tiny rewards.

                    <p>
                        If they don't mark mastery, then points run the risk of becoming arbitrary and meaningless.

                        They may still motivate some learners because the incentive structure is still there, but could undermine the goal; learners face challenges and complete tasks for the quick hit of dopamine rather than as a way to develop their skills.

                <p>
                    We already mentioned it a little earlier, but now let's dive into how points might connect to the need of relatedness. When it comes to relatedness, <em>connection</em> is key. <b>Points</b> need to bring learners together or allow learners to feel like they are contributing to something larger than themselves. Here are some examples of meaningful and shallow implementation that you can experiment with.

                    <p>
                        Like in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, perhaps learners' earned points could contribute to a shared collection for their group (or the entire classroom). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The implementation is critical, however, since <em>competition</em> between groups could lead to <em>shame</em> for learners who don't or can't contribute as much as others. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The culture of the classroom matters greatly, and as such, any inclusion of points needs to be considered carefully.

                        Points that are allocated only to individuals or for individual purposes can undermine relatedness, and can lead, intentionally or unintentionally, to comparisons between learners, often creating or reinforcing inequalities. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This doesn't always happen, but the potential is there and needs to be considered when experimenting with points.

                    <p>
                        Leaderboards that show the progress of learners can embarrass those toward the lower end, especially if there are inequities that have not been addressed.

                <p>
                    <b>Badges are qualitative markers that represent milestones.</b>
                </p>
             </div> 
             <p>
                They function similar to points, but are categorical rather than numerical.
             </p>
             <p>
                 One benefit of badges is that they have more symbolic meaning than points, which are more likely to feel arbitrary. This ties into another benefit of badges, which is their flexibility. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only can badges be earned through point accumulation (if desired), but learners can acquire them through non-points methods, too, such as helping other learners, or through more personalized ways like "Most Improved" or "Peer Recognized" or "Creative Problem Solver". 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of drawbacks, much like with points, if they are overused or aren't attached to meaningful milestones, then they can lead to extrinsic motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In games, badges are one of the most common mechanics used. Many games use them as meta-game extras for those focusing on completion or who want bragging rights for accomplishing a particularly arduous achievement.

                But badges appear in the non-digital world, as well. Belt ranks or colors in martial arts often indicate the skill level and a form of mastery. Merit badges express specific accomplishments or skills.

                <h2>Autonomy</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, let's consider how this very common mechanic connects to the self-determination theory need of autonomy. When it comes to autonomy, the key is <em>choice</em>, so <b>badges</b> need to represent some kind of meaningful decision.
                </p>
                <div class="gm-meaningful">

                            Meaningful Implementation

                        </span>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Given autonomy's requirement of choice, a meaningful implementation might be allowing a learner to create the design or name of the badge, as well as have some say in either which ones to pursue or how each badge might be earned (within the parameters set by the educator). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Badges are best when they attach to challenges that "go above and beyond" or "take a unique approach". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And allowing learners to make their own badges (within guidelines) may make a teacher's job a little easier than if the instructor were to design all the content themselves.

                    <p>
                        A sense of independence and personalization is often connected to choice. As such, a shallow implementation might be using or making a single set of pre-canned badges for all learners to strive for (without their input).

                        <li>
                            Some learners prefer less autonomy for the promise of discovery, whereas others may feel boxed-in by the structure; how might you balance these perspectives if you choose to build badges into your lessons?

                <p>
                    Relatedness is all about connection. Badges can promote or undermine that, depending on their implementation. Let's see examples of badges can be implemented, in meaningful and shallow ways.

                        One way to meaningfully implement badges is by making them peer-based.

                    <p>
                        Learners have the opportunity to look for and notice positive things their peers are doing and award them with badges.

                In games, progression is critical for keeping players engaged because without meaningful progression, players might get bored or frustrated and stop playing.

            <p>
                Education is very similar. Educators scaffold their topics and provide different levels of challenge for different learners in order to, ideally, keep learners in a flow state.
            </p>            
            <p>
                In both games and education, progression provides meaningful goalposts to aim for. Ones that feel achievable and consistently push them out of their comfort zone.

                    The goal of this "skill tree" is to give learners a guide for how they, and their peers, are progressing with different competencies during the course of the term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step is that the teacher will need to prepare the competencies that the learners need to master by the end of the term. Ideally, the teacher will already have a good sense for the scaffolding. <em>Optionally</em>, include the learners in balancing the scaffolding to help them build intuition for doing so for themselves in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the scaffolding, give the learners a general tree-like structure for them to be creative with. The learners will collectively bulid a tree out of construction paper that has a variety of branches. On each branch, have them place symbols representing different kinds of challenges. Even though the tree is primarily cosmetic, it may still provide enough <b>autonomy</b> and generate motivational buy-in for learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Note:</em> Each branch should have related skills that build on one another as a learner goes from the trunk to the leaves. Each next step will build on previous ones. These activities are largely created/determined by the teacher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the degree the teacher wants to build in more <b>autonomy</b>, allow different pathways up each branch, or even allow learners to select which branches (i.e., class content) they want to engage in first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Competence</b> is naturally built in by the teacher providing the scaffolding that is visualized by the learners through the branches of the tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the class moves through lessons and learners practice new skills, they'll reach mastery moments. These are areas of the tree where learners can reflect on what they've learned, write their thoughts on a Post-It Note, and stick it on that part of the tree. This represents <b>relatedness</b>, since they'll get recognition for reaching that milestone and can feel a shared sense of belonging and support as more learners also reach it. It may even inspire them to mentor learners who are finding it difficult to climb certain sections of the tree.

                Stories are an integral part of being human. We teach, learn, share, understand, connect, and generally communicate through stories.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Some games are full of stories, and the entire gameplay revolves around those tales. On the other hand, some games have no story or limited narrative structure. But, they still have stories, since the players' journeys end up becoming the stories. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A great example of this is <em>Pandemic Legacy</em> since players go through a series of games where their actions and decisions impact the unfolding story. It also happens to be an excellent cooperative game.

                <h2>Autonomy</h2>
                <p>
                    When we watch movies or read books, we often have little or no influence over the story. This is true of many games, as well, though games at least give us a semblance of control due to all the other aspects that provide <b>autonomy</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some books, movies, and games also fall into the choose-your-own-adventure genre, but it's challenging to design meaningful choices that do more than change some minor plot points or eventually end in the same result. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The essential concept for autonomy when it comes to the story game mechanic is the ability to impact the narrative.

                    For story to be effective for communicating competence, it needs to be clearly linked to what is being learned. Even a quick sentence or two that adds framing can help tremendously.

                <p>
                    On the <b>first index card</b>, each group will write a short setting for the shared world. Each group will then reveal what their setting is. After all settings have been revealed, learners will use ranked-choice voting to whittle down the options to the one that reaches a majority. That winner will become the setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the <b>second index card</b>, each group will write a short sentence for the overall conflict happening in the story. Repeat the ranked-choice voting method to choose the conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the <b>third index card</b>, each group writes a short sentence on how the learners think the story could connect to what they are learning at the moment. Repeat the ranked-choice voting method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the <b>fourth index card</b>, groups point out how this world is different from the real world. Feel free to use ranked-choice voting here, or try turning it into a discussion instead if desired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the <b>last index card</b>, with a lot of the overall structure of the world being created by the learners, allow each of them to contribute their own unique part to the world. This might be a character, city, natural or artificial phenomenon, creature, historical event, etc. Have them aim for it to "make sense" within the rules established thus far (i.e., setting, conflict, how it connects to the competencies, and how it's different from the real world) whenever possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use this world to help build out the story and activities that are interlinked with the story. Repeat or modify as needed to continue letting the learners create the world and guide the direction of the narrative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By allowing learners to create the story and vote on it, they fulfill both <b>autonomy</b> and <b>relatedness</b>. <b>Competence</b> comes through the gradual building of the story and its elements, during this initial storytelling session, as well as through future iterations that continue to develop the narrative. In addition, it also supports <b>competence</b> by providing the teacher with a general structure and plenty of learner-created content to experiment with as they design the lessons and activities.

                In games, especially digital games, the sandbox genre is probably the closest we get to co-design. Some games allow for players to create their own games or levels using the tools provided, like in the <em>Mario Maker</em> games, too.

                In education, co-design is a useful mechanic to include because it shifts learners' mindsets from consumers to co-creators of educational content.

                <p>
                    The main idea with autonomy when it comes to co-design is allowing learners to have the ability to meaningfully direct various elements of their own learning.

                        One idea is to use a what, when, how, and why kind of framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The teacher picks, say, what needs to be done and why, and the learners have an opportunity, within certain constraints, to determine the when and how. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows for enough choice that learners have autonomy, but where teachers are able to set boundaries to ensure the material is learned.

                        One shallow implementation would be to ask learners for their input on different elements, but then ignore the input altogether or modify it so heavily that it no longer resembles what the learners came up with.

                    Much like how competing against an opponent with roughly equal skill can often teach more than solo learning, or working together with a peer allows for the exchange of novel ideas and perspectives, co-design can encourage and accelerate growth through an apprentice-like model.

                    One recommendation is experimenting with assessments.                  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take one element of the learning environment, process, or experience and allow learners to brainstorm new ideas to try out. In this way, it primes learners to challenge systems critically, looking for ways to improve them. Having them do so collaboratively empowers them further, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, let's take assessments as the experimental part for this week, month, or terms (or other time frame that seems appropriate). In preparation for the proposals that the learners will design, the teacher will need to set the constraints and potentially provide example alternative methods of assessment in case learners are not sure what is available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In their proposals, learners should give reasoning (i.e., hypotheses) for why they think their chosen assessment will work and ultimately the teacher will give reasoning for why an idea will or won't work given pedagogy and other requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the learners and teacher have agreed upon a set of experiments to try out, the learners should test those experimental assessments one at a time. For each, they should report what their hypotheses were, what worked, what didn't work, and how they might improve the assessment or use it in a different way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By letting them experiment, the learners have <b>autonomy</b>. By having the learners given reasoning for their ideas, and by having them listen as the teacher gives their reasoning, as well, <b>competence</b> is satisfied. And, when done collaboratively, this co-design session promotes <b>relatedness</b>.

             <p>
                Collaboration is very common in our society. Most complex projects are too big for individuals to complete within a reasonable time frame and often require collections of skills that take years, and even decades, to hone. As such, it's an important mechanic to implement and skill for learners to develop.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Forbidden Desert</em> is a great example of collaboration in games since each player must communicate well, share resources, and work together to survive long enough to find the pieces of a flying machine hidden in the desert.

                        Without guidance on how to manage conflict or embrace everyone's ideas and thoughts, sometimes learners expressing more dominant behaviors can take over, potentially devolving into either a more hierarchical or "one person does all the work" dynamic.

                    Assign groups (or allow learners to self-organize). Then give the groups their challenge(s).

                <p>
                    To promote <b>autonomy</b>, the first step is for each individual learner to use the Post-It Notes to write down 3-5 ideas, questions, concerns, examples, solutions, etc. related to the challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To encourage <b>competence</b>, the next step is for each group to combine all their individual Post-It Notes on a board or wall or desk. They'll categorize the different notes, moving them as needed to form the different clusters. Along the way, they'll need to make a case for why these need to be moved or clustered in the way they're proposing; this encourages deeper thinking on the topic and groupings and exposes them to new ideas and perspectives from other learners. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To promote a sense of <b>relatedness</b>, each group can then narrate their collective understanding of the challenge, including and reflecting each member's contributions in some way.

                In reality and in games, competition provides a sense of comparison, which is useful since it helps you know where your current behaviors, actions, or performances are relative to other people, to some set standards, or to yourself.

                Competition is incredibly common and can be extremely motivating. Success feels good, especially when it's earned through dedication and growth. At the same time, it can be disheartening if you can't seem to win regardless of how hard you try.

                    Competition often includes a social component, but its implementation can cause the amount of connection the participants feel to vary. Let's see some examples of when connection might be stronger or weaker.

                    <p>
                        Competition where participants are well-matched (i.e., roughly similar skill levels) can also promote relatedness.

                        Zero-sum games tend to promote a single winner, winner-take-all kind of mindset. If the competition is entirely focused on that kind of win or lose perspective, then it can promote disconnection.

                    The overall goal is to provide a few different projects/competitions for learners to participate in. 

                    To provide <b>autonomy</b>, the learners can choose which project to participate in. Ideally, they will have the ability to choose between:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Competing against themselves</li>
                        <li>Competing individually against others</li>
                        <li>Competing as a team against other teams</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To promote <b>competence</b>, include discussions that focus on learning from mistakes, celebrating creative solutions or strategies, and allowing learners to reflect on their own growth through the competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For teams, <b>relatedness</b> can be fostered through encouraging each member to embrace their own skills and also learn from their teammates. The same can occur for individuals. If they compete against others, have them focus more on learning from their opponent. If they are competing against themselves, have them reflect with others who chose the same (or a similar) project to learn from each other.

                    <b>Roleplay is essentially inhabiting different perspectives than your own, often expressed as playing as a character with their own personality, viewpoint on life, and lived experiences.</b>
                </p>
             </div> 
             <p>
                This happens in a lot of roleplaying games and action adventure games since you're often playing as a character or party of characters. These characters typically have their own rich inner worlds and interactions and dynamics with other characters. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In D&D, players will often create their own characters and play as those characters, taking on their mannerisms, making decisions based on what those characters would do, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other games, like <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, have you assume a character with certain stats. While the characters are pre-defined, players still get to roleplay as those characters, making choices how they think those characters would act.

                In education, roleplaying could allow learners to build empathy and the skill of perspective-taking. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It could also be a way for them to channel traits of certain careers or people, such as applying design skills by "thinking like a designer" or mentoring peers by "thinking like an educator."

                        It might evolve into mannerisms with deep character development or having the learner make difficult choices they would not normally make based on their understanding of their role.

                <p>
                    Relatedness is largely about contributing to a shared experience, but is also about feeling safe while expressing vulnerability. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be a surprisingly vulnerable experience to roleplay as a different character, so a meaningful implementation will likely address that as best as possible.

                    <p>
                        Not all roleplay is theatrical, so allowing learners to take on different perspectives through other media can be quite beneficial for feeling like they can contribute to the shared imagination without needing to behave in specific ways. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allowing for different types of roles and methods of expression is likely produce  meaningful connections between learners.

                        One shallow method is to force all learners to participate and to do using a single form of expression, such as acting.

                    <p>
                        Another involves the roles themselves; characters that are too one-dimensional. or that depict stereotypes can produce disconnection and perpetuate problematic biases.

                        <li>
                            A variety of roles written on index cards

                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is for each learner to get three index cards. On every card is a different role. These roles can be created ahead of time or co-created with your learners. Learners may not look at their index cards ahead of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allow the learners to divide into various groups based on medium of expression. Some may choose acting, others writing, drawing, etc. Allow them to switch groups as desired. This freedom promotes <b>autonomy</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the topic or subject the class is currently learning, randomly select a scenario and read it aloud. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The learners who have chosen to act will have five to ten minutes to come up with a skit given one of their random role cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The non-acting learners will use this time to write or draw based on one of their own random role cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the five to ten minutes are up, have all the learners quickly share their expressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Repeat as time and interest permit.

                <p>
                    By working in small groups and discussing each other's approaches to the scenarios, learners will experience <b>relatedness</b>. The act of looking at the scenario with a different perspective can also promote <b>competence</b> as they practice thinking in new ways.

            <h2>Act VI - Gameful Design</h2>
            <p>
                As we saw above, each game mechanic can be implemented in <span class="meaningful-implementation">meaningful</span> or <span class="shallow-implementation">shallow</span> ways. The trick is the intentionality behind their design.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Gameful design</b> doesn't have to involve digital tools since many of these game mechanics can be implemented using paper prototypes, discussions, or other analog media and methods. <em>Please take a look at and modify any of the "non-digital recipes" that resonate with you.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                But arguably, the most important part of design is <b>empathy</b>; designing for learners depends on how they each (and collectively) experience <span class="autonomy-name keyword">autonomy</span>, <span class="competence-name keyword">competence</span>, and <span class="relatedness-name keyword">relatedness</span>. When we design our environments (e.g., classrooms, trainings, etc.) to intentionally foster <b>choice</b>, <b>mastery</b>, and <b>connection</b>, we're not only helping our learners learn better, we're helping them thrive as human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll leave you with one final question:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b><em>How might you pursue intrinsic motivation in your own learning spaces?</em></b>
